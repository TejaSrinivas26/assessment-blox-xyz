"""The provided code defines a simple BankAccount class with three main methods: deposit, withdraw, 
    and transfer. Below is a short explanation of each method:

    deposit(amount): This method is used to deposit a given amount into the bank account. It increases 
    the account balance by the specified amount.

    withdraw(amount): This method is used to withdraw a given amount from the bank account. It checks if 
    the account has sufficient funds (balance greater than or equal to the withdrawal amount) and deducts 
    the amount from the account balance. If there are insufficient funds, it raises an InsufficientFundsError exception.

    transfer(to_account, amount): This method facilitates transferring a given amount from the current 
    account to another bank account (to_account). It uses the withdraw method to reduce the balance of 
    the current account and the deposit method of the target account (to_account) to increase its balance."""


"""Banking works by transferring money from account A to account B. Most of the time
account A is in one bank while account B is another bank. Implement the code to
transfer money. Remember, payee's code runs on a different computer than that of
the receiver's code.
1. What are the issues in such a system?
    Security: The system must be secure to prevent unauthorized access to or modification of financial data.
    Accuracy: The system must be accurate to ensure that the correct amount of money is transferred to the correct account.
    Availability: The system must be available to users at all times, or at least within a reasonable timeframe.
    Scalability: The system must be able to handle a large volume of transactions without performance degradation.

2. What can we do to mitigate some of the issues ?

    Use strong encryption to protect financial data.
    Implement a robust authentication and authorization system to prevent unauthorized access.
    Use checksums or other data validation techniques to ensure the accuracy of transactions.
    Implement a load balancing system to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
    Use a distributed database to store financial data.

3. Write the fixing yourself to demonstrate the mitigations
This code fixes the 'BankAccount' object has no attribute 'transfer' error by defining a 
function called transfer that takes three arguments: the sender's BankAccount object, the 
recipient's BankAccount object, and the amount to transfer. The function first checks if the 
sender has enough money in their account to make the transfer. If they do, the function then 
hashes the transfer request and sends it to the server. If the server returns a successful response, 
the function then updates the balances of the two accounts. Otherwise, the function raises an exception."""
